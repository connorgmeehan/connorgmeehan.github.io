We ended up deciding on 4 areas to conduct user research and problem analysis so we could better understand the problem space.  \r\nSoomin’s areas to research were the application of autonomous vehicles in the field of fast medical aid in emergencies and the application of autonomous vehicles distributing food and clothing to Sydney’s homeless.  The two areas I would be researching was the application for autonomous vehicles to augment the mobility of elderly and disabled citizens as well as using on demand autonomous vehicles as a solution to congestion in areas of Sydney without trains.\r\nOur goal for next week was to meet on Wednesday with our findings, before the tut, to decide on the most suitable area to focus on.\r\n","Week":1,"_id":"5bb86d83bb108e02eb23e582","createdAt":"2018-10-06T08:08:35.214Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-06T09:16:39.907Z","__v":0,"id":"5bb86d83bb108e02eb23e582","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Area of focus research","Date":"2018-10-04T14:00:00.000Z","Content":"I began by trying to understand the general consensus on automated vehicles. RAC’s Autonomous Vehicle Survey shows that up to  The greatest concern was a lack of control in the case of system malfunction, followed by cyber security and responsibility in the case of an accident (n=955).  I also found that the public was most comfortable riding autonomous vehicles in areas with `few/no other vehicles`, `short rides - under 10 mins` and `Low speed limit areas`.  Furthermore, seeing autonomous vehicles `operate first hand` and `research showing they are safer than traditional cars` would increase a customer’s chance of adoption for 50% of surveyed individuals (n=1005).\r\nI then began exploring the room for AVs increasing the efficiency of public transport.  It’s clear that customers are not yet comfortable riding automated vehicles down main roads or for true long range point-to-point services. This reframes the problem in to providing a local service on controlled quiet streets or a point-to-hub service, where commuters are able to take conventional public transport options from the drop off point.  A local service will be available in the third quarter of 2018 in Sydney Olympic Park, providing autonomous transport in a shuttle bus running on a pre-programmed route on controlled roads.  Alternatively, we can see a non-autonomous on-request point-to-hub service already offered in Sydney’s Northern Beaches in which a user requests a shuttle service via the app and is picked up by a shuttle and taken to a local transport hub.  While increasing the efficiency and convenience of public transport is an important issue, I believe there is enough discussion and solutions currently in the works that our options for innovation are limited.  However, understanding the current implementation of point-to-hub transport and driverless shuttles are valuable resources when building our own solution and resultingy, research on these areas will be important to conduct.\r\n\r\nI followed by researching the problem space of driverless vehicles for the mobility impaired seniors.  With the aging population feeding an increased demand for healthcare workers, a workforce to only be spread further as the younger generation shrinks, there is much room for autonomous vehicles to benefit.\r\nThere have been a number of improvements to aid the mobility of those with physical restraints, such as power steering, or for the less aware\u003cplease replace this phrase\u003e, such as GPS, and parking or lane changing assistance. However, the benefit of these improvements are not equally shared and do not extend to those with severely reduced independence and mobility through physical limitations or a deteriorating mental state.  Furthermore these limitations result in reduced social access, as well as reduced access to medical aid and work or volunteering options.  This is an area where driverless vehicles offer a valuable solution in closing the mobility gap.\r\nIt’s evident autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly benefit the aged care environment from increasing mobility to reducing pressure on a shrinking workforce and therefore I think this is the most suitable area of focus for implementing an autonomous vehicle solution for this assignment. \r\n  \r\nRAC (2016) Autonomous vehicle survey, p3, Perth, WA. https://bit.ly/2vszVQV \r\nBloomberg Government (2016), Public Perception of Driverless Cars, p4-5, Washington, DC, USA https://bit.ly/2ORDHLG\r\nTransport NSW, The Research Hub (2017) Driverless shuttle bus trial, Sydney, NSW, https://bit.ly/2MaNnlO\r\nTransport Nsw (2018) Ride bus, Transport on demand.

We decided on senior mobility through AVs as we believe it is a problem that is becoming increasingly more important, has the most room for improvement and is an honourable cause.  I conducted further research into the problem space of autonomous vehicles for senior citizens as we collaboratively outlined the questions for a survey, which Soomin then designed.  We further outlined plans to conduct competitor analysis into the UI of on-demand shuttle service Ride Plus, Sydney Olympic Park’s autonomous shuttle and GrabShuttle, a point-to-point shuttle service based in Singapore (with a far more refined UI than Ride Plus), as well as services such as Uber and Lyft.  Finally we agreed that I’d be able to conduct the user research by visiting my grandma’s senior housing complex and door knock for some survey results.\r\nDrivers over 70 in the US are shown to take fewer, shorter and closer trips, often self regulating their own driving in perceived hazardous conditions.  They’re also shown to prefer volunteer drivers or shuttle busses over prepaid taxi or bus and rail services.  These preferences are ultimately decided by the perceived familiarity of a service.\r\n![text](/static/research_stats_1.png)\r\n![text](/static/research_stats_2.png)\r\nDuring the development of our User Interface we must take care to foster a feeling of familiarity or develop a new sense of familiarity through social transit.  \r\nHowever, following the Volkswagen emission scandal, General Motors failing ignition switches as well as a number of local airbag withdrawals, there is clear reason for lack of confidence in, not only autonomous vehicles but, the automotive industry as a whole.  Resultantly,  significant effort through: user control, transparency and customer assistance, should be made to go above and beyond when addressing these concerns.\r\n","Week":2,"_id":"5bb871379f07610012f96e44","createdAt":"2018-10-06T08:24:23.764Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-06T09:07:34.256Z","__v":0,"id":"5bb871379f07610012f96e44","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Next steps and reworking process journal","Date":"2018-08-30T18:00:00.000Z","Content":"During the tutorial we asked our tutor a good way to approach the next assessment.  Her recommendation was to combine our findings into a design brief and action plan, from which we’d base the rest of the assessment. \r\nResultingly, after the assessment we formulated just that. The design brief ([avaliable here](/static/design_breif_final.pdf)) re-iterated our problem, target user group and included the vision of solving accessibility for senior citizens through the metaphor of a ‘Helpful Friend’ who aids without being patronising.  Furthermore, it covered emotional, usable and technical requirements and a plan for achieving all of this.\r\n\r\nAs for the website, I needed a way to pass and filter the Process Journal entry data to decouple my app logic with my view logic.  I opted for the singleton pattern that could be accessed from any class needing post information and gave it a number of methods to aid getting data as well as event emitters for when the post to be viewed changes.

Following the lecture and tutorial, we began the Tutorial with our idea in mind.  However, after speaking to Sophie we quickly realised we had raced ahead of defining the problem we were solving and instead were focusing on a solution without basis. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe were stuck in the rut of building a specific product we had in mind so we went back to step one and outlined problems in areas of interest that we’d like to solve.  Brainstorming these problems formed the groundwork for visualising the problem space of elderly mobility which, although we returned to, reset our view of our design process and opened us up to new ideas.  We were no longer building a UI for a on-demand driverless shuttle but a UI for a product that would solve a number of these outlined problems surrounding senior citizens.  We mapped every social, medical, monetary and well being and quality of life problem we could think of in a network of relations which helped break down the relationships between issues senior citizens face.\r\n\r\nFrom there I will research the key issues outlined in the network to understand the severity of the problems which I will then translate into a rough problem severity heat map.\r\n","Week":2,"_id":"5bd021bd5396e000157f510d","createdAt":"2018-10-24T07:39:41.116Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-24T08:35:16.279Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd021bd5396e000157f510d","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Searching for a problem space","Date":"2018-08-10T14:00:00.000Z","Content":"![text](public/uploads/165ede9a42274b718cfbd905da951cd8)\r\nI built the problem heatmap from 4 publications on Australia’s senior citizens, Older Australia in a Glance, Heath and Active Aging, Aging in Australia and the Aging and Aged Care section of Australia’s welfare 2017: in brief which I used to create a layer mask to visualise areas of interest to research further.\r\n\r\nI found that there were two main issues:\r\n1. Maintaining a good level of self care, especially around household chores, correct nutrition and oral hygiene.\r\n2.

We decided to focus on volunteer caretakers, and gauge the current state of applying for volunteering with an online questionnaire that Soomin posted to a number of facebook groups.  Furthermore, we planned to conduct a pizza-incentivized focus group, directed for those who have experience volunteering, to better understand the process of getting involved, what sacrifices are made when volunteering and problems stopping volunteers from contributing as much as they could.  \r\n\r\nAs for senior citizens, we had planned to door knock at my grandmother's retirement village with a questionaire.  However after calling my grandmother with a pilot interview, I realised the questionaire format wasn't suited for the task.  **The questions were confining, foreign and unpleasant for senior citizens. **\r\n\r\nWe changed our plan of attack, **instead focusing on semi-structured interviews** that would allow for an enjoyable and natural conversation flow while still providing us with valuable data.  As a result of our prior research, these interviews were to be focused around positive experiences in cooking, self care and access to resources to guage what currently works, as well as pain points to see where we can apply autonomous vehicles to enhance their wellbeing. \r\n\r\nBecause semi structured interviews were difficult to apply to door knocking, I began phoning up retirement villages in the area to see if we could interview some of the residents.  One villages, The Manors of Mosman, showed interest and I was able to organise interviews for the Monday next. \r\n","Week":3,"_id":"5bd022d05396e000157f5110","createdAt":"2018-10-24T07:44:16.596Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-25T09:39:54.116Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd022d05396e000157f5110","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Interview with Nanna","Date":"2018-08-18T20:00:00.000Z","Content":"I caught the bus to my grandma’s place in Avalon where she stay at a retirement village called pittwater palms.  Having spoken to her briefly on the phone and feeling like i jumped a little too quickly into possibly insensitive questions, I opted to take a more conversational approach.  I aimed to door knock and interview more more senior citizens but, having planned to meet 3 elderly people from the Manors of Mosman, decided to stay longer with my grandma which ended up being very interesting.  I tried to cover all of my research objectives without pushing the conversation too much into a dead end. \r\n\r\nAt one point during the interview her neighbour knocked on the door who was 94, blind and deaf yet still living at home.  She needed help washing a sheet so we went over and helped her.  It was interesting to see how someone so limited in their senses lives their life.  I asked if I could speak to her but she said she can’t have anything new that throws her off her routine or she’ll lose her bearings.  \r\n\r\nOverall I found my grandma had a comparatively good standard of living in terms of isolation and comfort.  She had limits cooking, cleaning, shopping but due to a helpful (and large and local) family, and a down payment and real estate inflation she is able to live comfortable.  However I made an effort to explore the alternatives for those who did not have the same support network.  How people her age must suffer in painful circumstances out of lonely necessity.

The document is avaliable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QqEO3c3wnnzxTK_DfQ56m82maB52DokBTKP405xy9Gw/edit?usp=sharing) and covers behaviours and opinions on cooking, cleaning, socialising, staying active and access to facilities.  Going in I only knew that the owner had organised three participants to chat for half an hour each.  I spoke to Mrs Laine, a quite elderly lady in a serviced apartment; Lin, a younger, more active retiree living independently; and Judith, an elderly but lively ex-speech therapist who was helping residents work through and accomodate for developing speech impediments, also in a serviced apartment.  \r\n![Uploading The-Manors_02.jpg]()\r\n\r\nDuring the interviews I saw recurring themes of difficulty cooking, and residents limitting themselves to simple meals; a strong reliance on external structure and aid, such as eating out, paid cleaners and scheduled exercise run by the retirement village.  One of the most interesting perspectives was from Judith and her indepth perspective of those with hearing difficulties. She claimed that 90% of residents isolation and loneliness could be attributed to hearing difficulties which resulted in the seniors being perceived as rude and disinterested. \r\n\r\nHaving finished analysing the unstructured interview with my grandma, I began working through the 3 other interviews.  Relistening to the recordings and taking notes for use in the report. \r\n    I then continued working through the report requirement by requirement, without understanding how each section would lead into the other.   While I think I showed a good progress of coming to our problem of interest, I don’t think I prioritised each area effectively, nore did I make a separate report and presentation.  I finished the description and justification of the chosen research methods, and interpretation of findings on the diverging segment of the design process.  I tried to analyse all my results by writing down key points, as if it were an english assignment, but this was frustrating and I gave up when I had to go to class.\r\n\r\n","Week":4,"_id":"5bd192bfa8500f00111fe88d","createdAt":"2018-10-25T09:54:07.257Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-25T10:21:00.232Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd192bfa8500f00111fe88d","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Finishing research reseach report and getting affinity diagraming","Date":"2018-08-22T14:00:00.000Z","Content":"I arrived at uni early, with the goal of developing my findings, choosing an area of interest and presenting this through user personas.

She thought I said Wednesday when I messaged her after calling Joanne on Friday.  I think given the communication mishaps I need some framework for sharing info and giving good feedback.  Non the less she had her concept and her wireframes and could walk each resident through how it worked and gauge their opinions on it.  While this isn't comparable to user testing when developing a design, it proved to be valuable enough as we ultimately cut AV integration from the Senior Citizen side of the appq.\r\n\r\nWe arrived early and said hello to Joanne, she'd organised 4 participants.  Wew, she got some.  That'll do.  We went through the lofi prototype I had spent the busride inserting in a Pop prototype and asked them what they were doing, what they thought was happening and if they had any issues.  The designing for senior citizen principles I had researched weeks earlier proved to be useful as **those who did pickup the app understood the process well enough to finish the basic user flows I had developed** on signing up, requesting aid and getting in contact with the volunteer.  However we did see the they had **difficulty with, and a lack of interest in getting aid that forced them to travel on an AV** such as going to a library to get help with their phone.  This was because of a lack of confidence in the capabilities of current self driving technology.  We decided to change our concept to focus the AV aspect on the younger, less cautious volunteers.  On the simpler ui flows, there was confusion with sloppy, inconsistent language used on action buttons but this was a matter of refinement.  Additionally, most participants reported owning a tablet and prefering it over their mobile phone.  Additionally, 1 of the 4 participants, one didn't test our app as she'd forgotten her glasses and found my scribbles too hard to read.  Resultingly we decided to complete the hifi wireframes and prototypes designing for tablets.\r\n\r\nWhat was interesting is that one participant refused to use the prototype what so ever.  While I knew senior citizen's would have these views of technology, I hadn't formed a back up plan if I was interviewing one.  I made smalltalk to not seem rude but at one point I was helping him with his minimal _old person_ phone and I said _\"It's awfully loud isn't it\"_.  He replied _\"at least you know something's happening\"_ which was an important point about the level of feedback required. \r\n\r\n","Week":9,"_id":"5bd23b81a8500f00111fe8cf","createdAt":"2018-10-25T21:54:09.549Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-26T04:19:49.930Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd23b81a8500f00111fe8cf","Carousel":[{"_id":"5bd295e5a8500f00111fe8d7","name":"mrs laine.png","sha256":"_PiXAtuyZqapWZF8hCqCLoUk9Q9-UaZOA++WclgQLlg","hash":"0b3b9b44d49640058b85a430fe5e4b72","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":"702.92","url":"public/uploads/0b3b9b44d49640058b85a430fe5e4b72.png","provider":"local","related":["5bd23b81a8500f00111fe8cf"],"createdAt":"2018-10-26T04:19:49.942Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-26T04:19:49.947Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd295e5a8500f00111fe8d7"},{"_id":"5bd23b81a8500f00111fe8d1","name":"Screenshot_2018-10-26_08-48-49.png","sha256":"XxG7qeEHB1j8n1IXFrL2gJcd5xwuVmcFULUX8cRAZQA","hash":"7ccd2068432843eb811dac55ed43214c","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":"1113.11","url":"public/uploads/7ccd2068432843eb811dac55ed43214c.png","provider":"local","related":["5bd23b81a8500f00111fe8cf"],"createdAt":"2018-10-25T21:54:09.572Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-25T21:54:09.579Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd23b81a8500f00111fe8d1"}]},{"Title":"The rest of the midsemester break","Date":"2018-09-26T13:00:00.000Z","Content":"I went to melbourne to see my best friend.

Additionally, my tutor recommended it and so it became the choice. \r\n\r\n  I'm glad we got to split the prototypes between us as my designs were based on user research that Soomin hadn't completed and certain design decisions may not have translated as clearly as I would have liked.  Additionally, this choice wont be critically damaging to the design consistancy as because of the difference in requirements between the two products.\r\n\r\nThat night I punched through as much of the prototype as I could, hoping to get feedback from the designer and user tester at work.","Week":11,"_id":"5bd2b0c4a8500f00111fe8ec","createdAt":"2018-10-26T06:14:28.713Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-26T06:14:28.717Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd2b0c4a8500f00111fe8ec","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Another short, work focused group meeting","Date":"2018-10-17T15:00:00.000Z","Content":"Intitially the prototype was intened to only follow the UI flow for requesting aid but because of how enjoyable Proto.io was to use, I ended up finishing the whole app (sans initiating the fow for when a volunteer is coming over).  I tested the app with some peers who helped me refine the information heirarchy and add a great sense of linearity and direction by describing a three step process in the tutorial.  This theme was followed throughout the UI to provide context on where the senior citizen was up to in the sign up process. \r\n \r\nI also began focusing more closely on the companion website and process journal.","Week":12,"_id":"5bd2b14fa8500f00111fe8ed","createdAt":"2018-10-26T06:16:47.989Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-26T06:40:26.979Z","__v":0,"id":"5bd2b14fa8500f00111fe8ed","Carousel":[]},{"Title":"Feedback from designer at work","Date":"2018-10-19T13:00:00.000Z","Content":"I ran him through the embarrassingly primative prototype I had developed the night before and consumed all the feedback he had provided.

I didn't have time to make all of the changes that I'd have liked and was finding it difficult to maintain consistent work.  Again the end of the assessment was rushed (to make way for the process journal and companion website) but I'm beginning to think that's more the nature of the subject than something that I should feel bad about doing.  Ultimately good planning can remedy this but it means I don't have to be as hard on myself.
