Brief &#x26; Objective</h3>\n<p>Koala and Joey was the outcome of Interface Design Studio, a formative subject of the Bachelor of Computing Design at the University of Sydney.  We were tasked with devloping a solution, in a problem area of our choice, employing autonomous vehicles and some form of digital interface.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With AVs poised to reshape society we wanted to find an application for autonomous vehicles to solve a societal problem.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"../koalajoey-exploreideas.png\"></p>\n<p>After exploring autonomous vehicles' application to disaster releif, public transport and humanitarian services we decided to focus on solving <strong>problems faced by senior citizens</strong>.  With an aging population and an archaic, insufficient aged care system, we beleived this topic <strong>had the greatest potential for an effective solution</strong>. </p>\n<h3>2. So, what sucks when you're old?</h3>\n<p>As a team we conducted <strong>6 semi-structured interviews</strong> with senior citizens at a local aged care home.  On top of notes taken during the interview, the recordings were transcribed for later analysis.  This was followed by a further <strong>8 observational studies</strong> on the way senior citizens use public transport.</p>\n<h1><em>INSERT AFFINITY DIAGRAM</em></h1>\n<p>We analysed the records in an <strong>affinity diagram</strong> finding a range of issues from hearing loss to loneliness to money anxieties.\nHowever, two discoveries stood out most to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Senior citizens struggled most with the short and infrequent tasks, such as shopping and taking the bins out.</li>\n<li>Senior citizens spoke about aged care as something they'd regretfully have to submit to.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which got me thinking, <strong>how can we use autonomous vehicles to address the first point and prolong the time before the second becomes necessity</strong>.</p>\n<h3>3. How can we make it suck less</h3>\n<p>We began exploring solutions in grocery delivery drones, using AVs to promote social events and on demand transport however, after seeing that most pain points of the users could be addressed by solving those key difficult tasks, we decided to focus on that area.</p>\n<p>Additionally, because loneliness was by far the most prevalent issue we recorded, we wanted to use autonomous vehicles in a way that promotes human to human interaction.</p>\n<p>With these two concepts in mind, we landed on the idea of using <strong>autonomous vehicles to promote short bouts of volunteering</strong> in those key areas.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our goal was to improve the livelihood of the elderly, but now how can we benefit the volunteers?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To understand volunteers goals, needs and fears we conducted a focus group with 6 students who had experience volunteering in different sectors.\nWe heard </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Every [volunteering] signup process is different\"</li>\n<li>\"And they dont get back to you for ages\", </li>\n<li>\"There's never enough info, you don't know what you're signing up for\",</li>\n<li>\"I enjoy doing it [volunteering], it's just hard to plan around \"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we could provide a <strong>better volunteering experience</strong> that results in much needed support being provided to senior citizens without aged care plans then we had a concept. </p>\n<p>We identified we'd need two UIs.  My group member, Soomin, was to develop an interface for volunteers and I for senior citizens.</p>\n<h3>4. Early prototypes and testing</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Developed number of pen and paper wireframes.</li>\n<li>Received feedback from eachother and tutors</li>\n<li>Built lofi prototype in Pop t\no emulate interactivity</li>\n<li>Tested with 4 senior citizens</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Founds:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Avoid text input, instead use valuable &#x26; generic defaults</li>\n<li>Linearity is king, senior citizens are not as used to parallel processing of text as us.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>5. Hi fidelity wireframes</h3>\n<h3>6. Final Product</h3>\n<p>With AVs poised to shape society, we wanted to find an application that solved a social problem.
